# Overview

The Pomodoro Timer App is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time more effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, and it involves breaking work periods into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

This app includes all the features necessary for practicing the Pomodoro Technique, including:

- Timer for work intervals (default: 25 minutes)
- Timer for short breaks (default: 5 minutes)
- Timer for long breaks (default: 15 minutes)
- Customizable theme options
- User-friendly interface with a clean design
